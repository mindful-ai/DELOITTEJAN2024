1. L = ["apples", "banana", "cherry", "guava", "kiwi", "watermelon", "orange"]
    Sort the above list with respect to the last charecter
2. Consider the wordjumblegame (OOP) version. Along with the points print the time taken
   by individual players in the report, example:
   FINAL SCORES:
    Akhilesh         |  4   |  17 seconds
    Vidhi            |  6   |  18 seconds

3. Write  a program to accept text from the user and provide a character histogram/frequency report
   of the input text.
4. Access 16_special_functions_and_modules.ipynb and replace the following logic with a map():
        # Extract all the extensions
        exts = []
        for file in os.listdir():
            ext = os.path.splitext(file)[1][1:]
            exts.append(ext)
        exts
5. Create a pandas series using a list of space separated numbers from the user? Name the series 
"user_series".
